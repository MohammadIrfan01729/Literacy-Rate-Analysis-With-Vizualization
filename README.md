# Literacy Rate and Enrollment Analysis by State and Gender

## Project Overview
This project analyzes literacy rates and educational enrollments by state and gender across India. It aims to uncover gender disparities in literacy and enrollment and provides insights into educational progress at the state level and by specific age groups. The study helps in understanding how education contributes to reducing gender inequality and empowering individuals economically and socially.

## Summary
This project analyzed literacy rates and enrollment statistics in Indian states, highlighting gender and regional disparities. Average literacy rates were computed across states and genders, and the analysis included age-specific literacy trends. Visualizations were created to compare literacy rates by gender across states for better interpretation. The project demonstrates how data analytics can reveal inequality patterns in education and prompt targeted interventions.

## Findings
- States like Kerala and Mizoram exhibit the highest literacy rates with minimal gender gaps.
- Significant gender disparities persist in certain states such as Rajasthan and Bihar, indicating social and economic challenges.
- Enrollment rates generally improve among younger age groups, reflecting recent educational initiatives.
- Female enrollment lags behind male enrollment, particularly in lower-literacy states, highlighting ongoing gender inequities.
- The study supports data-driven strategies to address educational gaps and promote equitable learning opportunities.
